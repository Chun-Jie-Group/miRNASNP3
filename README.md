## Summary

 <p>microRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous and regulatory non-coding RNAs by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression. SNPs on pre-miRNAs or target sites will affect miRNA expression or functions. <span class="badge alert-info">miRNASNP</span> is a comprehensive resource of human miRNA-related SNPs, including their effects on target gain and loss. In <span class="badge alert-info">miRNASNP<span style="color:red;">-v3</span></span>, <span class="badge alert-danger">6,363,450</span> SNPs on human <span class="badge alert-danger">1,897</span> pre-miRNAs(<span class="badge alert-danger">2,624</span> mature miRNAs) and 3'UTRs of <span class="badge alert-danger">18,152</span> genes were characterized. Besides, <span class="badge alert-danger">203,471</span> mutations from <span class="badge alert-info"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/" target="_blank">ClinVar</a></span> and <span class="badge alert-info"><a href="https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic" target="_blank">COSMIC</a></span> were identified on the pre-miRNAs(<span class="badge alert-danger">2,065</span> on mature miRNAs, <span class="badge alert-danger">522</span> on seed regions) and 3'UTRs. <span class="badge alert-info">Gene enrichment</span> of targets gained or lost by SNP in the miRNA seed region is provided.</p>
